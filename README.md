# news blog
The task was to create a news blog.
I used the Django framework. Addition of the post is carried out in the administration, and for their editing I used Ckeditor applications. This is the HTML code editor. To upload images to the server, use the Pillow application. Also provides protection: XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, Clickjacking protection, SSL / HTTPS, Host header validation. Used Bootstrap.
